# Lolorito
Lolorito is a tool for sifting though market data in FFXIV (requires Java 1.8 or later)

It takes the item data from [XIVAPI](https://github.com/xivapi/ffxiv-datamining) and uses the market data from [Universalis](https://universalis.app/) to find the current most profitable items to sell on the market.

## Getting Started
First just select what server you want to pull market data for, pick how far back you want the data to go, press update, and wait for it to finish updating.

When its done you can pick what category (these are also from XIVAPI; some are empty) to search in and any search term you'd like to use.

Finally just press search and the results will appar on the right.

The results are formatted most profitable top to bottom as: (item name) - (profitability %/100) - (average price) x (average size)

Example:
