# Lolorito
Lolorito is a tool for sifting though market data in FFXIV **(requires Java 1.8)**

It takes the item data from [XIVAPI](https://github.com/xivapi/ffxiv-datamining) and uses the market data from [Universalis](https://universalis.app/) to find the current most profitable items to sell on the market. It takes into account both how much items cost and how quickly they sell. Sometimes a larger quantity of a lower cost item can out perform a lot of high-price items that rarely sell.

## Getting Started
First just select what server you want to pull market data for, pick how far back you want the data to go, press update, and wait for it to finish updating.

When its done you can pick what categories to search in and any search term and sort type you'd like to use.

Finally just press search and the results will appar on the right. You can search as many times as you'd like. Updating the market data only needs to be done once.
